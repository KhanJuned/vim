# Vim color schemes
# Assuming you're windows user I don't know about Linux or Mac

This is just some colors and vimrc's file for vim

copy and paste colors(the folder in my repo) to C:\Program Files(x86) > Vim                                                       
and copy and paste _vimrc(file without .txt, actually it's a file with no extension) to C:\Program Files(x86) > Vim
