# vim color schemes
# Assuming you're windows user I don't know about linux or Mac

This is just some colors scheme for vim 

copy and paste colors(the folder in my repo) to Program Files(x86) > Vim                                                                
and copy and paste _vimrc(file without .txt, actually it's a file with no extension) to C:\Users\HP
and also to
